# Building a Mastodon Bot for Mankutimmana Kagga with Claude

**D.V. Gundappa's** *Mankutimmana Kagga* — 945 verses of timeless Kannada philosophy — deserves a wider audience. So I built a Mastodon bot to post one verse at a time, twice a day, complete with transliteration and English explanation. Here's how it came together.

## The Prompt

The project started with a simple ask to Claude: *"Create a Mastodon bot to post Kannada Mankutimmana Kagga verses with a short explanation, configurable on how often to post."* From that single sentence, Claude scaffolded a complete Python project — `kagga_bot.py`, `config.py`, `kagga_verses.py`, and a scraper to pull all 945 verses from a public repository.

## Features

- **All 945 verses** with Kannada text, Roman transliteration, and English explanation
- **Configurable schedule** — minutes, hours, or daily at a set time
- **Sequential or random** verse ordering, with persistent state across restarts
- **Smart 500-char handling** — tries full post, falls back to short tags, then posts as a thread if needed
- **Theme filtering** — post verses by theme (Wisdom, Death, Love, etc.)
- **Dry-run mode** for testing without posting

## Challenges

The biggest debugging headaches were unexpected. The scraped `kagga_verses.py` contained **literal newlines inside string literals** — causing Python `SyntaxError` on load. Several verses needed surgical `sed` fixes. Mastodon's **500 character limit** required multiple iterations of the trimming logic, especially since Kannada Unicode characters count as multiple bytes. The **Kannada hashtag `#ಕಗ್ಗ`** rendered incorrectly on Mastodon — the virama joining character was silently stripped. And PythonAnywhere's **free tier proxy blocked** outbound connections to `ioc.exchange`, requiring a paid upgrade.

## What I Learned

Iterative debugging with an AI pair programmer is powerful but requires discipline — patching the same function repeatedly with `regex` replacements eventually corrupts files. A clean full rewrite beats five patches.

The bot is live and posting. Check it out on GitHub: **[github.com/yourusername/kagga-bot](#)**
